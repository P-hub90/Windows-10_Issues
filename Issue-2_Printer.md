## Problem:
The network printer, which was previously connected and accessible, is no longer showing up in the list of available printers on the Windows 10 computer after the recent update.

## Potential Causes:
- **Driver Issues**: The printer drivers may have become incompatible with the latest Windows 10 update.
- **Network Settings**: The computer may have lost its connection to the printer over the network.
- **Printer Settings**: The printer might be offline or incorrectly configured, preventing it from appearing in the available printers list.

## Tests/Questions:
1. **Check Printer Status:**
   - Ask if the printer is still accessible from other devices on the network.
   - Check if the printer's display shows any error messages or if it's in an offline state.
2. **Restart Printer:**
   - Suggest restarting both the printer and the router to refresh the connection.
3. **Recheck Network Connection:**
   - Verify if the computer is connected to the same network as the printer.
4. **Check Printer IP Address:**
   - Ensure the printer has the correct IP address and is on the same subnet as the computer.
5. **Reinstall Printer:**
   - Try removing the printer from the system and adding it back by navigating to **Control Panel > Devices and Printers > Add a Printer**.
6. **Update Printer Drivers:**
   - Ask if the printer drivers are up to date. If not, guide Sarah on how to visit the printer manufacturer’s website to download the latest drivers.
7. **Run Printer Troubleshooter:**
   - Suggest running the built-in **Printer Troubleshooter** by going to **Settings > Update & Security > Troubleshoot > Printer**.

## Suggested Fixes:
- **Reinstall Printer**: Remove and re-add the printer to ensure proper detection.
- **Update Printer Drivers**: Install the latest drivers for the printer from the manufacturer’s website.
- **Check Network Settings**: Ensure both the printer and the computer are on the same network.
- **Set Printer to Online**: Make sure the printer is not set to offline mode in the printer settings.
